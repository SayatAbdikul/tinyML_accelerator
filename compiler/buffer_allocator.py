"""Liveness-based linear-scan buffer allocator.

Pre-P4 (2026-05-09 era), `compile.py` used hand-rolled ping-pong:

    mat_buf            alternated 1 ↔ 2     (FC / Conv weights, LOAD_M)
    bias_vector_buf    alternated 3 ↔ 4     (biases, LOAD_V)
    gemv_buf           alternated 5 ↔ 6     (GEMV outputs)
    relu_buf           alternated 7 ↔ 8     (RELU outputs)
    conv_out_buf       alternated 10 ↔ 11   (CONV2D_RUN outputs)
    pool_out_buf       alternated 12 ↔ 13   (MAXPOOL outputs)

This works for strictly linear graphs (every tensor consumed by exactly
one downstream op) but breaks the moment three same-class tensors are
live simultaneously — residual connections, branching, skip-connections.
The double-buffering silently overwrites a still-live tensor.

(It also masked a separate latent bug: the matrix-buffer ping-pong used
IDs {1, 2} even though MATRIX_BUFFER_COUNT == 2, so RTL silently truncated
the buffer-ID field's high bit and aliased ID 2 → physical buffer 0. This
was harmless for double-buffering but is exactly the kind of "works by
coincidence" pattern P4 removes.)

Algorithm — liveness-based linear scan:

  1. Compute the topological order of nodes.
  2. Compute `last_use_idx` for every tensor name: the topo index of the
     last node that consumes it. Aliasing through Reshape / Flatten /
     BatchNormalization is propagated so a buffer stays live as long as
     ANY name in its alias chain is still being consumed.
  3. Walk topologically. At each step:
        a. Free buffer IDs whose tensor's `last_use_idx < current_idx`.
        b. For each new tensor introduced by the current node (initializer
           inputs, op outputs), allocate a free buffer ID from its class
           pool — vector for activations / biases, matrix for weights.

API surface used by compile.py:

    assignments = allocate_buffers(model, ordered_nodes,
                                   vector_count=16, matrix_count=2)

`assignments` is a {tensor_name: buffer_id} dict. Aliased tensors share
an ID. compile.py reads from this dict and never maintains its own
counter; this is the lock-in for the structural fix.
